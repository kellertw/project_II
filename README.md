# Project II


# Topic

Produce visualizations depicting  financial crime reported by casinos in the Southwest region of the U.S. by county to determine the risk level associated with different counties.


# Visualization ideals 

Novel JS dropdown menu/item
Interactive map
Heatmap
Choropleth map


# Dataset

Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) is our nation’s financial intelligence unit, which collects, analyzes, and disseminates financial intelligence, such as Suspicious Activity Reports (SARS) that track alleged illicit activity reported by financial institutions. Found at: https://www.fincen.gov/reports/sar-stats

U.S. Census provides geographic data by county that we implemented to generate our maps.

# Rationale

Plotting U.S. Treasury SARs filtered by different states/counties on a heatmap will assist law enforcement, regulators, and other financial institutions that serve casinos to better understand the risk level of crime types experienced by different counties at various locations. For example, casinos situated along the California-Mexico border may be a higher risk for counterfeiting associated with foreign exchange thus bumping up their crime incidence reporting.
