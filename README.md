Rationale

Plotting U.S. Treasury SARs filtered by different states/counties on a heatmap will assist law enforcement, regulators, and other financial institutions that serve casinos to better understand the risk level of crime types experienced by different counties at various locations. For example, casinos situated along the California-Mexico border may be a higher risk for counterfeiting associated with foreign exchange thus bumping up their crime incidence reporting.
